###Legend of Zelda speedrunning-  Which rooms kill runs?
This is the part 2 of my series on analyzing speedrunning of Legend of Zelda  (check out part 1: Legend of Zelda speedrunning - top 5 time wasting rooms)
Today we're going to look at a simple question while examining my Arcus87 dataset, which rooms in the speedrun kill the most runs? After exploring and becoming familiar with the data, I thought of two different ways to think about this question. First, I could count the run of times a run ended in particular room, I call this the **kill count**. Second I could calculate how likely the run is to end in that room, I call this the **kill fraction**.  

The kill count  gives a clear indication of which room are most troublesome in shear numbers.  It is heavily weight toward the begining of the run, since if the run gets off to a bed start, it's likely to be reset.  The kill fraction however, gives a better indication of the rooms overall difficulty of the room

Which rooms

How does this compare to my previous results

Some biases
- reseting runs based on time
- 30-30 routes

Some technical notes
