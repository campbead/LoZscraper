This project is analysis of Legend of Zelda (1986) speedruns from [Arcus87](https://www.twitch.tv/arcus87/).  Here I include my Arcus Twitch Vod Scraper (Python), the scaper data, and my analsys (R Markdown)

## Background

I got into watching speedrunner's on Twitch and while back.  In particular I was got into  who was into speedrunning Legend of Zelda (1986), for the NES, a game a played a lot of as a kid.  

Watching him, I thought it would be cool to collect some data on how his speed run was progressing, and I had a few questions: 
- Which rooms give him the most trouble?
- How big a deal is it to have the "beam-sword"?
- How much better is he getting over time?
