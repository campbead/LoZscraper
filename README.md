Scraping data from Legend of Zelda (1986) speedruns.  Get time, number of hearts, rubies, bombs and other information..

## Background

I got into watching speedrunner's on Twitch and while back.  In particular I was got into [Arcus87](https://www.twitch.tv/arcus87/) who was into speedrunning Legend of Zelda (1986), for the NES, a game a played a lot of as a kid.  

Watching him, I thought it would be cool to collect some data on how his speed run was progressing, and I had a few questions: 
- Which rooms give him the most trouble?
- How big a deal is it to have the "beam-sword"?
- How much better is he getting over time?

This a the tool I create to scrape data from data from Legend of Zelda speedruns from Arcus87's Twitch broadcasts.
