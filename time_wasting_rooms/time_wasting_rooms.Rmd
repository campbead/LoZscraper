Here we are interested in find out what rooms are the most time wasting.  We'll get to exactly how I will define that later.  But for now let's just setup the environment and load the data.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

all_run_data <- read.csv("../data/arcus_LOZ_data.csv")
```

Now we will find the median time for each room in all the data we have.

```{r}
room_data <- all_run_data %>%
  group_by(Room) %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  summarise(med = median(Duration))
```
